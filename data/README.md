# NetMan Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the NetMan tool:

- `inventory.json`: The main device inventory in JSON format
- `ansible_inventory.yml`: Ansible inventory file generated from the main inventory

These files are automatically created and maintained by the NetMan tool.
Do not modify them directly unless you understand the structure.
